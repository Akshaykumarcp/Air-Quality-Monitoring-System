# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
In this project we are going to make an IOT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System in which we will monitor the Air Quality over a web server using internet and will trigger a alarm when the air quality goes down beyond a certain level, means when there are sufficient amount of harmful gases are present in the air. It will show the air quality in PPM on the LCD and as well as on webpage so that we can monitor it very easily. In this IOT project, you can monitor the pollution level from anywhere using your computer or mobile.

Components used :-

MQ135 Gas sensor
Wi-Fi module NodeMCUESP8266
Breadboard
1K ohm resistors.
